    "**Ans:** Below are the advantages of functions in programming:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Ans:** The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is specified. When a function is \"called\" the program \"leaves\" the current section of code and begins to execute the first line inside the function. Example is mentioned below:"

    "**Ans:** There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called. A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function whereas A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope."
